This directory contains the result of our analysis, included figures showing traces from the MCMC. Currently, objects from `LaplacesDemon` are saved as .Rda files, which can be quite large. We will soon add FLAT files containing the summary parameters (some runs may already have these). In the meantime, we are happy to provide these for specific runs on requests. Each run should also contain a README.md file providing the commande used to run the file.
